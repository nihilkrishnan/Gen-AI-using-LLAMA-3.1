## GEN AI USING LLAMA 3.1
Generative AI using LLaMA 3.1 focuses on leveraging Meta’s latest language model to build an intelligent system capable of generating human-like text. This could include applications like chatbots, text summarization, content generation, or code completion. By fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1 with domain-specific data, you aim to enhance its accuracy and relevance for specific use cases. The project likely involves integrating the model into a web or software application, optimizing performance, and ensuring ethical AI usage.

- Text Summarization and Paraphrasing
- Code Generation and Assistance
- Question-Answering Systems

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10/11, Ubuntu 20.04+, or macOS) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks and efficient model deployment.
Development Environment: Python 3.9 or later is necessary for coding the LLaMA 3.1-based generative AI system.
Deep Learning Frameworks: PyTorch for model training and inference, along with Hugging Face’s transformers library for integrating LLaMA 3.1.
NLP Processing Libraries: SentencePiece for tokenization, LangChain for advanced text processing, and OpenAI API integration (if needed for comparisons).
Version Control: Implementation of Git and GitHub/GitLab for collaborative development and effective code management.
IDE: Use VSCode, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and testing.
Backend Development: FastAPI or Flask for API creation to process user queries and generate AI-based responses efficiently.
Frontend Development: React.js or Next.js for building an interactive UI to interact with the AI model.
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user interactions, preferences, or generated content (if required).
Deployment & Scaling: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for auto-scaling, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure for hosting.
Performance Optimization: Use of ONNX/TensorRT for faster inference, model quantization (bitsandbytes), and mixed precision training for memory efficiency.
Additional Dependencies: Includes NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV (if using image-based text inputs), Weights & Biases for model tracking, and accelerate for efficient LLaMA execution.
